# Ultimate Cat Clicker: Fishing Edition™ 🎣🐾

A cozy, pixel-art clicker made in pure HTML/CSS/JS.

Click, catch, upgrade, and uncover a quiet story about healing, survival, and what it means to *move on*.

## 🐱 About the Game

**UCC: Fishing Edition** is a standalone side story in the **Ultimate Cat Clicker (UCC)** universe.  
Unlike other entries focused on chaos, currency, and cat upgrades, this one takes a softer path. A moment of stillness in the Catverse.

You’ll play as a lone feline who’s been through something.  
But by the lake, there's no yelling. No hunger. No noise.  
Just fish…  
and peace.

## 📖 Lore: The Cat’s Journey

They never said goodbye.  
They just… left you.

You don’t remember why.  
Only the cold porch. The dark night. The sound of rain.

You wandered for days, hungry and afraid, until you found a quiet lake with no people — only fish.

You fish not just to survive… but to remember.  
And maybe one day… to forgive.

With each catch, the memories fade.  
With every coin, the ache grows lighter.

When the final upgrade is bought…  
the cat’s journey comes to an end.  
A peaceful ending. A soft one.  
You made it.
